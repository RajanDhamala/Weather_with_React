# React + Vite
# React Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Official Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Feel free to explore these plugins to enhance your React development experience.

Happy coding!
## Weather App

This is a weather app that allows users to input a location and view the current weather as well as a 5-day forecast. The app displays information such as temperature, weather status, humidity, wind speed, and icons representing the weather conditions.

To use the app, simply enter the desired location in the input field and click the "Search" button. The app will retrieve the weather data from a weather API and display it on the screen.

Feel free to customize the app according to your needs and add any additional features or functionalities.

Happy coding!
